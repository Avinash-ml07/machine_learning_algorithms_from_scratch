I have build following machine learning algorithms from scratch:
         1.Linear Regression<br>
         2.Polynomial Regression<br>
         3.Logistical Regression<br>
         4.Decision Trees<br>
         5.Neural Networks(includes calculating binary and multi class predictions)<br>
         6.Anomaly detection algorithm
